# Flashcard-Generator
Boot Camp HW 11 - Backend node app to create 2 types of Flashcard and store them.

- Type 'node entry.js cloze' to generate prompts to enter 10 quiz statements and the text within that will be removed for guessing.
- Type 'node entry.js' to get prompts to enter 10 quiz questions and answers, as is done on flashcards.

App stores the cloze cards in the ClozeCard.json file and the standard flashcards in the BasicCard.json file.

Object constructors are defined in ClozeCard.js and BasicCard.js modules.

App uses node modules:
- Inquirer
- fs

Personal:
  I learned that I need more study on the use of object constructors and node modules.
